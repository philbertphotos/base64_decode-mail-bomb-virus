# base64_decode-mail-bomb-virus

Found this virus on my site it a pretty clever thing.
Hopefully this helps someone.

I still dont know how I got infected/compromized but basicly when it runs its gets our domain and loop through creating random generated names and sends spam all over. john_doe@yourdoamin.com

Reason I found it because me logs got full real quick ...
